# Our Mission (1/2)

Grace Lutheran Church, a church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
has been at the heart of the faith community in Lincoln since&nbsp;1889.  

We are deeply committed to our mission: Making Christ known to all through Grace.

We celebrate our purpose: "That by God's grace we have been gathered to worship, called to witness, and sent to serve."

We are excited about our vision: "To become a church with a passion for fostering a welcoming community that strives for peace and a sense of belonging."

Welcome to Grace Lutheran.  This is Christ's Church.  There is a place for you

name for the life of the world.
